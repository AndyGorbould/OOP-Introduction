# OOP-Introduction

The goal of these exercises is to learn how OOP works in PHP, the correct useage of access modifiers (public, private, protected), & how to debug errors when these are set differently.

Exercise 1
Creation of a "class" with properties of different datatypes (string, float etc).
Property defaults; ($this->temperature = "cold";) >> do not put this in the __construct >> modify through a "setter" (following exercises!)
Class function getInfo() with void return type (this is to stop the func returning a value as it has an "echo" directly in it)
How to use __construct to create a new object

Exercise 2
